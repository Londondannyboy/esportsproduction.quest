# Remote Esports Production

Remote production has revolutionised esports broadcasting, enabling professional-quality broadcasts without gathering entire crews at physical venues. This guide covers how to plan, execute, and optimise remote esports productions.

## What is Remote Esports Production?

Remote production (also called distributed production or at-home production) involves producing broadcasts with crew members working from different locations. Instead of everyone being on-site, team members connect through the internet to collaborate on live productions.

### Benefits of Remote Production

**Cost Efficiency**
- Eliminated travel expenses
- No venue rental for production
- Reduced equipment transport
- Lower accommodation costs

**Flexibility**
- Access to global talent pool
- Easier scheduling
- Scalable crew size
- Quick deployment for events

**Scalability**
- Easy to add or reduce crew
- Multiple event coverage
- International crew integration
- Faster response to opportunities

## Remote Production Models

### Fully Distributed
All crew work from home or personal studios:

**Best For:**
- Online-only tournaments
- Budget-conscious productions
- Regular weekly content
- International crew requirements

**Crew Setup:**
- Director at home studio
- Observers at personal setups
- Graphics operators remotely
- Commentary from home studios

### Hub and Spoke
Central production hub with remote contributors:

**Best For:**
- Hybrid events
- Productions needing some co-location
- Complex technical requirements
- Training new crew members

**Setup:**
- Core technical team at hub
- Remote observers and talent
- Centralised switching and streaming
- Distributed content creation

### Player Remote, Production On-Site
Production crew on-site, players play remotely:

**Best For:**
- Studio shows with remote matches
- Invitational events
- Content-focused productions
- LAN-style production without player travel

## Technical Requirements

### Internet Connectivity

Each remote crew member needs:

**Minimum Requirements:**
- 50 Mbps download
