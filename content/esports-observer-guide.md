# Esports Observer Guide

Esports observers are the camera operators of competitive gaming broadcasts. They control what viewers see, capturing the most exciting moments and crucial plays that tell the story of each match. This guide from [Esports Production Services Quest](/) covers everything you need to know. See our complete [esports production services](/) on the homepage.

## What is an Esports Observer?

An esports observer (also called an in-game cameraman or spectator) controls the game's spectator camera to capture gameplay for broadcast. Unlike traditional camera operators who work with physical equipment, observers work within the game itself, using spectator tools to show the action.
